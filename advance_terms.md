# Compile-link model
compile-link model for generating executable binaries from the source code

Creating an executable is a multistage process divided into two components: compilation and linking. In reality, even if a program "compiles fine" it might not actually work because of errors during the linking phase. The total process of going from source code files to an executable might better be referred to as a build.

## Compilation 
Compilation refers to the processing of source code files (.c, .cc, or .cpp) and the creation of an 'object' file. This step doesn't create anything the user can actually run. Instead, the compiler merely produces the machine language instructions that correspond to the source code file that was compiled.

 ## Linking 
 the linker takes the object files produced by the compiler and produces either a library or an executable file.
