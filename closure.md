# Golang Lazy Evaluation using closure
> What is a closure in computing? \
In computer science, a closure is a function that has an environment of its own. In this environment, there is at least one bound variable (a name that has a value, such as a number). The closure's environment keeps the bound variables in memory between uses of the closure.

## Higher-order function
In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function as its result. All other functions are first-order functions. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed operators or functionals.

A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output. Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	igen := intGenerator()
	fmt.Println(">>", igen()) //2
	fmt.Println(">>", igen()) //4
	fmt.Println(">>", igen()) //6
	//igen = nil

}

type genType func() int

func intGenerator() genType {
	x := 0
	return func() int {
		x += 2
		return x
	}
}
```
## Lazy loading using sync.Once

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

type LazyInt func() int

func Make(f func() int) LazyInt {
	var v int
	var once sync.Once
	return func() int {
		once.Do(func() {
			v = f()
			f = nil // so that f can now be GC'ed
		})
		return v
	}
}

func main() {
	n := Make(func() int { return 23 }) // Or something more expensiveâ€¦
	fmt.Println(n())                    // Calculates the 23
	fmt.Println(n() + 42)               // Reuses the calculated value
}
```

## [Lazy loading implementation using higher order functions](https://go.dev/play/p/Ty8vpd52TaI)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Double(x int) int {
	return x * x
}

func Double2(x, y int) int {
	return x * y
}

//func(x int) int, x int) int
func ClosureFunc(a func(x, y int) int, x, y int) int {
	return a(x, y)
}

func main() {
	//fmt.Println(">>", ClosureFunc(Double, 5))
	fmt.Println(">>", ClosureFunc(Double2, 5, 6))  
}
```
